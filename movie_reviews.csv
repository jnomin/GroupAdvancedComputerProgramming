"For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of ""Shrek"" on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I'll just end it here!",Positive 😊
"I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the ""libretto"" if you will can be ""read"" at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!I add here that I've watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.Nick Fortis Los Altos California",Positive 😊
"A movie suitable for children, but really made for an adult audience. It's funny, has many quotable catchphrases and teaches us so much. It shows us that love has no limits, that you can find love where you'd least expect it and that beauty doesn't show only on the outside. It is also a great story about unlikely characters forming friendships that will last a lifetime.",Positive 😊
"This movie really confronts the problems with society, such as the opioid crisis, domestic abuse, and donkey mistreatment head-on. It was a great way to talk about these issues with my teenage son.",Negative 😠
"The originality of this cinematic masterpiece is striking, as it exxxpertly blends layers of popular Indo-European fairytale culture with a creative, meaningful yet comedic story of discrimination, valour, love and lust for power.Ogreall, it is a true must-watch for fairytale fanatics of all ages.You are what you eat.",Positive 😊
"9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of ""Shrek"". We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up ""WHAT's he compensating for?"" cracked me up...Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you'll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it's not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in ""Shrek"".As a fairytale, however offbeat, ""Shrek"" is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare's comedies than fairytale formula, and the ""ugly is the new beautiful"" Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow's Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier's Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We're talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts.",Positive 😊
"Shrek is completely new.  Never has a fully CGI movie taken on the twists, turns, and surprises as Shrek has.  It's a full parody of numerous fairytales, and its humor is, well, humor at its best.  Grown men will laugh at the jokes of Farquaad's Stature and the hidden meaning behind every little comment.  Of course Shrek, like all other movies, has its emotional moments (so what if I lied about it being completely new?).  And these moments aren't cheesy or anything.  They are kind of funny, but at the time of viewing you won't really feel like laughing.  You'll feel like the characters.Like its CGI, Shrek has taken a new dimension.  It stretches out.  You're in the movie.  No, wait, you're watching a movie.  It's so hard to tell.  The characters are so real, so lifelike, it makes you feel you're there.  The environments are realistic, yet still animated.  The wind whispers through the grasslands and the characters' hair; the lightning and clouds are really there... aren't they?I was stunned and absorbed in this movie.  And unlike other movies, it has more than just CGI.  It's actually got a plot.  And what a plot it's got! This one is totally new.  Shrek is ordered to rescue a princess from the fiery keep guarded by a dragon in order to clear out his swamp of the menacing fairytale creatures.But it doesn't stop there.  The movie is full of surprises and stretches on further into what actually happens after.  The dialogue demands your attention throughout the movie, and then the dragon comes in.  Whenever you see the dragon, you'll know good things are bound to happen (but not necessarily for the characters in the movie).  The dragon is a comic relief, but still provides most of the action in the movie.  She chases Donkey and Shrek through the keep, she flies to help rescue Fiona from a despicable marriage, and she even has the satisfaction of swallowing a midget.Now some disputes have arisen about certain things.  But I must say what I always say:  this is only a movie, and it has no deeper meaning (despite the parodies).  Take it as it is.  There can be nothing offensive from Shrek unless you have something against overthrowing tyrants and good-natured humor.I must take a moment to speak about Donkey.  He is, and always will be, one of my most favorite characters in the world of movies.  Eddie Murphy was, no doubt, the perfect actor for him.  He is so funny, so unique, and so... fluffy.  What a perfect donkey!  His design is flawless and his dialogue perfect.  I can find nothing bad about this character.Shrek is perfect for everybody to see.  The little ones will love the vivid colors and lush landscapes.  The adults will enjoy this as well as the intelligent humor and deep plot.  And no one could dislike the arrangement of songs.  They fit really nice into the movie.  Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's composed music is impressive (especially the theme for Escape from the Dragon).Shrek is brilliant moviemaking.  With a groundbreaking DVD, an all-star cast, great music, excellent graphics, and a great parodized yet original plot and storyline, Shrek is no doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen.",Positive 😊
"I did not get to see this in theaters though my family got the movie on DVD that fall and it was one of my first DVD movies. The cast was excellent, especially John Lithgow and Mike Myers and the visuals were stunning. Many parts of the movie were spoofs of old films and there were many laughs to be heard. Cameron Diaz as the princess was good too, though she's hardly a damsel in distress. Which works nicely considering her abilities (which I won't say here). Some good songs and even a cameo by Disney cartoon veteran Jim Cummings. The CGI was good and very meticulously done. It could give Toy Story some good competition. The sequels were decent, but I prefer the first one. There's even music by Smash Mouth and many fairy tale creatures and characters.Bottom line: if you're tired of usual and cliched fairy tales and want a strong female lead, this is your movie. See it!",Positive 😊
"The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say ""that does not look right."" There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.",Positive 😊
"I saw this movie at a screening recently.  It was a delightful movie with something for everyone.  I think it will be as big a hit as ""Toy Story I and II.""  The computer animation is so realistic that it is great to watch. The donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice is a real crowd pleaser.  All in all, a winner!",Positive 😊
"There was little to no story, and what was presented as a story in the advertisements was done away with at the very begining of the film, I doubt that Shrek will hold this high of a rating for a long time (look how fast it took Phantom Menace to fall down the charts).In terms of animation it looked nice, but sheesh this movie was just another excuse to take cheap shots at Disney, and while most Disney animated films have morals, there was no redeeming value in this movie at all. The moral of the story was what? its okay to be ugly just not short?The characters were all pretty much annoying, and at the end of the movie which was where the Princess transforms its pretty predictable as I was thinking to myself as the smoke covered her body (okay so she's gonna change into a Ogre I'm wayy Ahead of you guys) its a direct cop out of a the Beauty and the Beast story we all know. I think it would have been a heck of alot better had she transformed into her female human self, and fell in love with the Ogre, at least that way it would have presented a message.Only message I found here is Peter Kratzenberg hates disney and well he can SUCK MY tape of Toy Story a film that still exceeds every 3d animated film ever made.",Positive 😊
I don't think humanity will ever create something that surpasses Shrek.,Neutral 😐
"How dare you triflin a** b**** give this master piece a 7.8/10 rating. if you give this anything less than 9 stars, we can fight in the taco bell parking lot",Negative 😠
"Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers.Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait.",Positive 😊
"Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together.Shrek is merciless in its humor. Targeting everything from fairy tales to Disney films to narrative clichés to bad puns, sliding in its own commentary, all the while giving the typical fantasy story a few modern twists and turns to deliver a strangely original unoriginal story with original unoriginal characters . . . that doesn't make sense, but Shrek does, does it well, and doesn't care. And you never know where this humor is going to come from, either  either visual gag, musical nod, or spoken dialogue. All three provide their share of narrative and commentary to the concepts in Shrek.I think the beauty of Shrek is it's taken the typical fairy tale (which all of us have heard), and it answers the silly 'what if . . .' and 'why don't they ever . . .' questions we tend to ask. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. If the audience can buy into Shrek and Donkey's relationship to one another, then they can believe entire film (which more or less focuses on the adventure the two share together). True, Shrek has a love theme . . . but it's Donkey and Shrek who sustain the film through most of the picture.As for Cameran Diaz and John Lithgow, while not on screen as much as our two heroes, still play an important role. I wouldn't want to downplay Lithgow and Diaz who do bring their respective characters to life, but Shrek is a tale about an enduring friendship with a romance story on the side.",Positive 😊
"I love this movie i watch it ever day teh soundtrack is so good i know the script.

"Once upon a time - not too long ago - a writer had an idea to write a fairy tale made up of various fairy tale characters. And thus, a franchise was born.You can't help but love 'Shrek' - the character and the film. Shrek is one of the most unconventional yet most lovable characters seen in an animated film in a while. His sidekick, Donkey, almost steals the show thanks to his witty dialogue and FANTASTIC voicing by Eddie Murphy. He's just adorable!Together, they embark on a dangerous and exciting journey to save a princess, but for very different reasons you might think. They have absolutely no interest in the princess whatsoever - or, at least, that's what Shrek thought...'Shrek' is a delightful and very funny action adventure film, with several underlying messages. Children will adore the film for its characters and funny moments, while the film will also appeal to a mature audience on a deeper level, which children wont really understand.This is a very clever, excellently executed script. The inclusion of the song 'Hallelujah' was just awesome, and very appropriate. And what a beautiful ending - the stuff fairy tales are made of!! I love it!'Shrek' was a huge box office sensation, earning $506 million on a $60 million budget. It also raked in 99 award nominations, winning 39, including an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. This is a classic!Would I watch it again? Absolutely.",Positive 😊
"Shrek has hidden messages that will likely sail right over the heads of its target audience. The resettlement of the fairly tale creatures in the villainous Farquaad's (ruthless and cruel Anglo-Saxon) kingdom is an allusion to the resettlement of Jews in ghettos carried out by many European principalities during the Middle Ages (at the time of Martin Luther, I think they were expelled from England, France and Spain but tolerated, with restrictions, in some German city states). The filmmakers seem to be suggesting that just as Farquaad did not appreciate the fairy tale creatures and their magical and unique abilities and may have in fact been afraid of them, so, too, were Europeans afraid of Jews and their foreign culture and thus unjustly persecuted them. Apparently, all for no good reason. Shrek, the ogre, of course, represents how the African would have been received in medieval European society. He is feared and misunderstood as a stupid, grotesque, and violent menace. Of course, we are shown that in his private moments, he is anything but these undesirable qualities and his moral fibre transcends his physical ugliness. The fact that the fair princess Fiona is revealed to really be an ogress is to confirm that well worn cliché that we are all the same inside. In a classic fairy tale, which Shrek is the antithesis of, written by someone like Hans Christian Anderson for instance, Farquaad would be the hero, Shrek the villain, and Fiona would indeed be the fairest maiden in all the land.",Negative 😠
"""Shrek"" is fun. People who haven't seen this movie, and are wary of seeing what's popular, should give it a try. It's worth watching, and will probably win you over.Taking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a ""Beauty And The Beast""-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers' over-the-top faux-Scots accent, ""Shrek"" shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon's target audience while registering with their parents. 'Sure it's big enough, but look at the location,' Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love 'Shrek' every bit as much. It's impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.Myers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He's a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.Cameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn't have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she's given.The comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek's donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he's never been this funny since the first ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movie. ""We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles,"" the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.Why exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn't clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams ""plot convenience,"" and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.But the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won't notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.This is not a Disney movie, something ""Shrek"" makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of ""It's A Small World""-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, ""Shrek"" could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture's freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time.",Positive 😊
"The movie Shrek created in 2001 was definitely one of dream works more eye opening children's films. It is filled with hilarious components for children but also there are some more adult jokes snuck in. I am not sure I am the only one that noticed this but when Lord Farquad tells the mirror to show him a picture of Fiona again, while laying shirtless in bed. He lifts the blanket and casually looks under it. This seems to suggest something is happening in this scene. If you know what I mean.
It has all the parts for an inclusive movie. And the surprising part of the story line that has to do with Fiona is most certainly unexpected and makes the story most not ordinary. When watching this keep in mind that this is not a normal fairy tale.
On the more negative side of things was how the story moved. Throughout the movie everything is very fast pace. The story just being set up, has far too many unnecessary components. This makes the time spent on the more important parts of the story shortened and rushed. And frankly it makes it a little repetitive since it's just one extravagant part of the journey after another. It's almost exhausting.",Positive 😊
"Shrek is a movie like no other.  It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is ""She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy.""  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp ""farting,"" that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike.",Positive 😊
